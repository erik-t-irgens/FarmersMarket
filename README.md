#### _DESCRIPTION - September 5th 2019_

#### _By **Erik Irgens**_

## Description

This application is a simple application that introduces the concepts of React, such as Props, routing, Links, and styling using CSS. The app itself is meant to be for a Farmer's market, where you may view items that are available in certain seasons, as well as see upcoming events and where they will be hosted. For now, these are hard-coded in and do not display accurate information or allow for user input.
